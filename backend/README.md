# Backend - ScanMate 1.0.0-X "Aurora"

## Overview

The backend of the ScanMate project is responsible for handling data processing, API requests, and business logic. It is built using Java and Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the application.

## Structure

1. **Spring Boot Application**:
   - The main entry point for the backend application.
   - Configures the Spring Boot environment and initializes necessary components.

2. **Controllers**:
   - Handle incoming HTTP requests and define API endpoints.
   - Process requests, interact with services, and return appropriate responses.

3. **Services**:
   - Contain business logic and handle data processing.
   - Interact with repositories to fetch and manipulate data.

4. **Repositories**:
   - Manage data access and persistence.
   - Interface with the database to perform CRUD operations.

5. **Models**:
   - Define data structures used throughout the application.
   - Represent entities such as products, orders, etc.

6. **Configuration**:
   - Set up various aspects of the application, including security, database connections, and CORS settings.

7. **Exception Handling**:
   - Manage and customize error responses for different scenarios.

8. **Utility Classes**:
   - Provide helper methods and common functionality used across the application.

9. **Testing**:
   - Include unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and correctness of the backend components.

10. **Build Configuration**:
    - Maven or Gradle files to manage dependencies and build processes.

This structure provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for the ScanMate backend, allowing for easy expansion and integration of new features as needed.

## Key Features

- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for fetching product data based on barcodes.
- **Data Management**: Handles product information and updates, ensuring accurate data is sent to the frontend.
- **Scalability**: Built with Spring Boot, allowing for easy expansion and integration with other services.

## How It Works

- The backend receives requests from the frontend to fetch product details.
- It processes these requests, retrieves data from the database, and sends it back to the frontend.
- The configuration ensures secure and efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

## Development

The backend is developed using Java and Spring Boot, leveraging Maven for dependency management. It is designed to be modular and maintainable, supporting future enhancements and scalability.
